# Workshop Overview
Lithium-ion batteries permeate our lives. They are used in a wide range of products from portable
electronic gadgets to electric vehicles and large container ships. These batteries are characterized
by low costs, long life times, and high energy densities. With the increasing focus on shifting from
fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, the demand for lithium-Ion batteries is expected to increase
significantly in the next decade. Some projections estimate that the market for lithium-Ion batteries
will increase from USD 41 billion in 2021 to USD 116 billion in 2030.

Despite their numerous advantages, there are several aspects of lithium-Ion batteries that are not
fully understood. In particular, there is limited understanding of the internal electrochemistry, the
aging process, and their ability to hold charge. Recent advances in battery design, modeling, and
operations led to significant improvement in their safety and efficiency. In this workshop, we will
introduce the attendees to battery design, modelling and estimation, and optimization of battery
operation. The emphasis will be on using modern modeling/parameter estimation methods in
conjunction with machine learning and optimization tools.
