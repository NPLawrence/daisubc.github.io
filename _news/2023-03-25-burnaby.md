The Process Control Department at the Burnaby Refinery is interested in exploring novel techniques for reducing manual labour and engineering time required for industrial control engineering tasks. The proposed research directions, in partnership with the UBC DAIS Lab, include leveraging modern deep reinforcement learning techniques for practical industrial applications, such as:

- Soft sensors development
- Industrial model predictive control and fault diagnostics
- Process data analytics
- Gain matrix conditioning

## Why apply?

- Explore and solve practical and industry-relevant control engineering problems
- Opportunities to interact with engineers and industry partners at the Burnaby Refinery, as well as other collaborators
- Develop expertise working with industrial control systems and technologies like Dynamic Matrix Control (DMC)
