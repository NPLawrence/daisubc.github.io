<p><strong>Almost Surely Stable Deep Dynamics</strong>
by Nathan P. Lawrence, Philip D. Loewen, Michael G. Forbes, Johan U. Backstrom and R. Bhushan Gopaluni</p>

<p><em>Abstract</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We introduce a method for learning provably stable deep neural network based dynamic models from observed data. Specifically, we consider discrete-time stochastic dynamic models, as they are of particular interest in practical applications such as estimation and control.  However, these aspects exacerbate the challenge of guaranteeing stability of a neural network dynamic model. Our method constrains the dynamic model to be stable subject to a neural network Lyapunov function. To this end, we propose two approaches: one exploits convexity of the Lyapunov function, while the other enforces stability through an implicit output layer. Numerical results are presented and the accompanying code is (will be) publicly available.</p>

  <li><strong>Data-driven Dynamic Inferential Sensors Based on Causality Analysis</strong> by <em>Liang Cao, Feng Yu, Fan Yang, Yankai Cao, R. Bhushan Gopaluni</em> - Control Engineering Practice, 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Considering the stringent requirements for product quality of complex industrial processes, the purpose of this study is to apply causality analysis to select causal features of quality-relevant variables; and then to improve the prediction performance and interpretability of inferential sensors. Based on the idea that low-dimensional causal features can approximate the underlying information of the process instead of the original high-dimensional measurements, feature causality analysis is proposed in this work. To describe dynamic information and extract efficient latent features, dynamic latent variable models are utilized to combine with feature causality analysis. After dynamic latent causal feature extraction, two kinds of inferential sensors are developed with extracted dynamic latent causal features. Several comparison studies have been implemented on the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process; the results show that the inferential sensors based on dynamic latent causal features obtain the best performance.</p>

  <li><strong>A Tractable Approximation for Stochastic MPC and Application to Mechanical Pulping Processes</strong> by <em>H Tian, J Prakash, VM Zavala, JA Olson, RB Gopaluni</em> - Computers &amp; Chemical Engineering, 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This paper develops a tractable approximation for stochastic model predictive control (SMPC). Under the proposed approach, we solve multiple deterministic MPC (DMPC) problems over individual scenarios of the uncertain variables to obtain a set of control policies and select from this candidate set a control input that yields the best approximation of the SMPC solution (i.e., yields the smallest statistical measure of the objective function (e.g., expected value) and of the constraints). This approach is a scenario decomposition scheme that overcomes tractability issues of SMPC (which solves problems that incorporate multiple scenarios all-at-once). Moreover, the approach enables flexible handling of complex statistical measures (e.g., medians, quantiles, and chance constraints) and enables prioritization of objectives and constraints (this is difficult to do with off-the-shelf optimization solvers). An application to a nonlinear mechanical pulping process demonstrates that the approach provides high quality solutions. We hypothesize that this is because the optimal SMPC policy lives in a space that is spanned by the control policies for the individual scenarios. Moreover, we note that a traditional DMPC policy corresponds to the policy of an individual scenario (the mean scenario is typically chosen). Consequently, the proposed approach can do no worse than DMPC and can be interpreted as an approach that seeks to find a DMPC policy that best approximates the SMPC policy.</p>
