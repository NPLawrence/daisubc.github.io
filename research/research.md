The DAIS Lab at the University of British Columbia conducts research at the intersection of *process control*, *data analytics* and *machine learning*.

On the applied research side, we develop novel algorithms and computational tools to solve industrial process control problems. We also explore fundamental problems in control theory and machine learning for theoretical insights.

## Research Topics:

We are interested in the development of smart plants and intelligent processes, which can be distinguished from traditional industrial plants by:

- Large-scale dynamic models
- [Maintenance-free controllers](./maintenancefreecontrollers)
- Automatic detection and diagnosis of faults
- Predictive analytics

## Past Projects:

Please see our [publications list](/publications) for more information on our past projects on:

- Nonlinear System Identification

- Fault Detection and Diagnosis in Nonlinear Stochastic Systems

- Metabolic Flux Analysis

- Pulp & Paper Control

- Diabetes Modeling and Control

- Experiment Design for Mammalian Cell Cultures

### Domains
