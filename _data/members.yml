  biography: >
    Originally from Tehran, Iran, as his B.Sc., Iman have studied mechanical engineering. Graduated ranking in the top 3 among more than 80 mechanical engineering students. So, he was honored with the title of exceptionally talented student by the Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) admission office, which allowed him to get admitted directly to AUT (which ranks among the 3 best Iranian universities) to start studying Mechatronics as his M.Sc.
    During his M.Sc. studies, he selected “Structural Health Monitoring of oil Pipelines” as the theme of his research, which introduced him to the world of IoT and Machine Learning. Most recently, Iman started utilizing various sensors and IoT devices in small projects through different online courses in the field of Machine Learning and also was introduced to Digital Twin concept. That’s why, he chose to start a PhD in the field of Industry 4.0 and Advanced Manufacturing at University of British Columbia, which he hopes he can gain more experience specially in Data Science, since he will be collaborating with both research groups at Composites Research Network (CRN) and Data Analytics and Intelligent Systems (DAIS) Labs. During his free time, Iman enjoys mountain climbing and fishing and also snow sports, which he loves to experience them all in BC.
