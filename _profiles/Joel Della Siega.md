  I was born and raised in Vancouver and I am in my fourth and final year of a Chemical and Biological Engineering undergrad. I am interested in the applications of machine learning to aid the development of regenerative medical therapies. I am a former varsity athlete (national champion high jumper) who still stays quite active and enjoys playing any and all sports. My spare time is spent coaching high jump, tutoring, and playing sports.
