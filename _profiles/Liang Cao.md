biography: Liang Cao is a Ph.D. student studying Chemical and Biological Engineering (CHBE) at UBC. He received his BASc and MASc in Automation/Control Engineering from Beijing University of Chemical and Technology in China. He also is a joint master student at the University of Duisburg-Essen (Germany) and a research assistant at Tsinghua University (China). His previous research includes diagnosis and compensation of multiple channel faults in one-dimension systems and two-dimension systems. His current Ph.D. research interests focus on applying machine learning techniques to historical refinery process data to build inferential sensors, extract causality, and mine sequence patterns.
